# eecs230 lab5

---------
Review
---------
- Classes versus Structs (private versus public by default)
- Operator overloading (in this lab you will overload `==`, `<<`, `+`, and `-`)
- Variable scope (local, global)
- Passing argument by reference (versus by value)

Exercise
---------

We are going to implement a class `Vector2d` which is composed of two private data members, constructors, getters, and setters. We placed the declarations in a header `Vector2d.h`. You are supposed to implement functions in `Vector2d.cpp`.

The function signatures are provided for you. Implement functions where you see “Implement Here.”

After you've implemented the functions, if you run the tests then they should pass.

Add more tests in `tests.cpp` and test as many cases that you come up with. Become familiar with the code, and modify as you see fit. Ask questions!
